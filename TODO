to DO

- prototype head scroll/layering
    chop, fall, bounce? 
    cover bottom block w/new blank layer
- design actual head

- lay out masthead
- lay out playlist
- lay out credits

- details for sidebar - show the movement










this week, make a guillotine that scrolls down and maybe slices a pepperoni
or a cock
or a head

vector graphics?

the top part follows when you scroll
sides are tracks
